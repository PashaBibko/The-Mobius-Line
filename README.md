# The Mobius Line

This is my FMP (final major project) that I created for my first year of Level 3 Game development. Windows downloads can be found under releases but if you wish to play via your browser you can play [here](https://pashabibko.itch.io/the-mobius-line).

### About

The mobius line is a speedrunning game built around non-Euclidean concepts set in the London Underground. Your goal is to get from one platform (the starting area) to the other (green wall) as fast as possible.
